                  It&nbsp;is&nbsp;the Client’s responsibility to&nbsp;make sure
                  that a&nbsp;package can be&nbsp;shipped. Clients must ensure
                  that a&nbsp;package’s contents, size, weight, volume,
                  destination and/or recipient are not subject
                  to&nbsp;prohibitions or&nbsp;restrictions in&nbsp;the country
                  of&nbsp;origin or&nbsp;destination country.

                <li>
                  The Client is&nbsp;responsible for, and warrants the

                  laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not
                  limited&nbsp;to, the export laws and government regulations
                  of&nbsp;any country&nbsp;to, from, through, or&nbsp;over which
                  the shipment may be&nbsp;carried. The Service does not
                  guarantee the delivery of&nbsp;packages which do&nbsp;not
                  comply with the import regulations of&nbsp;the destination
                  country or&nbsp;export regulations. The client also undertakes
                  to&nbsp;familiarize himself with the additional restrictions
                  of&nbsp;the courier company on&nbsp;the website
                  in&nbsp;advance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Service is&nbsp;not responsible for packages addressed
                  to&nbsp;prohibited countries, individuals, or&nbsp;entities.
                  If&nbsp;we&nbsp;cannot ship your package due to&nbsp;these
                  prohibitions and restrictions, you agree to&nbsp;either return
                  it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the original sender, or&nbsp;to&nbsp;send
                  it&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;different address.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Service is&nbsp;not responsible for packages which exceed
                  the size, weight, or&nbsp;volume allowed by&nbsp;individual
                  destination countries. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;the Client’s
                  responsibility to&nbsp;ensure that the package in&nbsp;which
                  they are shipping is&nbsp;within the size, weight, and volume
                  restrictions that apply in&nbsp;the country of&nbsp;origin
                  or&nbsp;destination.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All incoming mail is&nbsp;accepted in&nbsp;our warehouse,
                  identified, and added to&nbsp;the Client’s account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Client must ensure that the correct name, package number,
                  and mailing address is&nbsp;on&nbsp;every package sent
                  to&nbsp;our warehouse.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Service determines the owner of&nbsp;the parcel, after
                  it&nbsp;arrives at&nbsp;the warehouse, and adds
                  it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the Client’s account. If&nbsp;the owner cannot
                  be&nbsp;determined, and a&nbsp;claim with tracking information
                  is&nbsp;not provided within 14&nbsp;days, the package will
                  be&nbsp;disposed&nbsp;of.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Receiving and processing packages and mail is&nbsp;free for
                  all Clients. Processing consists in&nbsp;the consolidation,
                  packaging and transfer to&nbsp;a&nbsp;logistics company for
                  delivery to&nbsp;the selected address.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Service automatically provides two general view photos for
                  each incoming package upon receipt.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Service removes the original packaging for free and
                  repackages parcels before dispatching them. The Service
                  reserves the right to&nbsp;make the final decision on&nbsp;the
                  type of&nbsp;packaging of&nbsp;delivery methods.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Service also removes seller invoices and promotional
                  products from the final package for free.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The period of&nbsp;storage in&nbsp;the warehouse
                  of&nbsp;incoming parcels and outgoing parcels is&nbsp;counted
                  separately.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Free storage period of&nbsp;the incoming package
                  is&nbsp;30&nbsp;days from the date of&nbsp;registration
                  in&nbsp;the Client’s account. Further, the period
                  of&nbsp;storage of&nbsp;the parcel can be&nbsp;extended
                  on&nbsp;a&nbsp;paid basis up&nbsp;to&nbsp;90&nbsp;days. After
                  90&nbsp;days of&nbsp;storage an&nbsp;incoming package will
                  be&nbsp;recycled. If&nbsp;an&nbsp;outgoing parcel
                  is&nbsp;formed and packed in&nbsp;the warehouse, but payment
                  for delivery is&nbsp;not made within 14&nbsp;days, then this
                  package will be&nbsp;recycled too.
                </li>
                <li>
